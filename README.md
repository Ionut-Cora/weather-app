# Weather APP

## For this APP I used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Free openweather.org API

## APP description
This application helps everyone who wants to see the weather in real time, in their favorite location, city or country. The application is very simple, just write your favorite city in the search bar and click the submit button or press enter and some informations like outside temperature in Celsius, weather type, humidity, wind speed and few more, will be displayed and the background image will change, depending on the city name.
